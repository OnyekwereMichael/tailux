📊 Home Dashboard UI
Overview
This project recreates the Home Dashboard UI (just the home section, not the entire dashboard).
The focus is on layout, structure, and responsiveness, ensuring it works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

While I’ve kept the design close to the original reference, I also made small adjustments to improve spacing, readability, and mobile friendliness.

🛠 Tools & Frameworks Used
Next.js — For building a fast and structured UI.

Tailwind CSS — For rapid, responsive styling.

HTML & CSS — Base structure and custom tweaks.

(Optional) TypeScript-ready structure, though not strictly required.

📌 Assumptions & Creative Decisions
Only the Home Dashboard section was built (no extra dashboard pages).

Minor style tweaks were added for better text contrast and spacing.

Used Tailwind’s utility-first classes for faster development and consistent design.
